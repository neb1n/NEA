## About

My **NEA** is a work in progress right now. I'm currently working on the actual movie reservation system whilst also planning and complete makeover for the UI for the user. I kept this into Tkinter as it seems to be the way to go without going into HTML, CSS and JS.
The project documentation is also moving quite swiftly with the design section being added soon.

## Features

> 📆 Add, edit, and delete movies
> 📈 Track which seats have been taken
> 📊 View statistics and reports
> 💾 Data saved locally in a DB
> 🔁 Reset movies after deleting them or clearing reservations
> 🧩 Well-based structure
